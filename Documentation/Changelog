CHANGELOG

* 2015/02/09:

    - Added operators is, !is.

    - The compiler no longer raises exceptions on unknown datatypes.
      (useful when writing raw Python patterns, e.g.: datetime)

    - The '*' wildcard accepts a list of keys as argument.

* 2015/02/07:

    - Major operators overhaul.

      The full set is now:
          >, >=, <, <=, ==, !=, regex, !regex, in, !in, contain, !contain

    - Added directives: __limit__ and __sort__ for dictionaries.
      Sorting can be reversed using { "__sort__": "-key" }.

    - Added wildcards: key? (optional match) and "*": "*", which
      returns all the keys/values in the current dict.

    - Matchers/Constraints are no longer wrapped with (Match/Constraint)ToLists.

* 2015/02/05:

    - Added operators: >, >=, <, <=, ==, !=, ~=, |=.
